# README

Cadmus is a front-end to the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) documentation generator. The tool is written in Python 3 and parses custom docstrings from LaTeX files and generates output files using the reStructuredText markdown language. These files may then be included into a Sphinx build.

In addition to the documentation generator, the tool has a framework to manage automatic figure generation from snippets of TeX code, normally used to showcase a particular feature in a TeX package.

# Documentation
