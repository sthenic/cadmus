# README

Cadmus is a front-end to the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) documentation generator. The tool is written in Python3 and parses custom docstrings from any TeX file and generates output files using the reStructuredText markdown language. These files may then be included into a [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) build.

In addition to the documentation generator, the tool has a framework to manage automatic figure generation from snippets of TeX code, normally used to showcase a particular feature in a TeX package.
