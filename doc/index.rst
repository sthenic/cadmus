Documentation for Cadmus project
********************************

Cadmus is a front-end to the `Sphinx`_ documentation generator. The tool is
written in Python3 and parses custom docstrings from a TeX file and generates
output files using the reStructuredText markdown language. These files may then
be included into a Sphinx build.

In addition to the documentation generator, the tool has a framework to manage
automatic figure generation from snippets of TeX code, normally used to
showcase a particular feature in a TeX package.

The source code may be found in the project's `GitLab repository`_.
